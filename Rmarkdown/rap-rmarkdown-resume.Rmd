# EDUCATION

*University of California, Santa Barbara*, Master of Environmental Science & Management (MESM) \hfill 2014  
*Bucknell University*, B.A. Economics & Biology \hfill 2009  

# EMPLOYMENT

*Center for Watershed Sciences, UC Davis:*

 > **Graduate Student Researcher** \hfill 2014--present
 
 Research in stream ecology, amphibians, and montane aquatic ecosystems, with particular focus on linking physical cues with ecological function, and assessing ecological integrity with molecular techniques to understand current and future hydroclimatic impacts on hydro-regulated rivers in the Sierra Nevada.

 > **Jr. Research Specialist** \hfill 2011--2014
 
 Research in stream ecology and montane aquatic ecosystems, with particular focus on ecosystem function and hydroclimatic impacts on hydro-regulated rivers in the Sierra Nevada. Assessed hydroregulation impacts on biota, geomorphology, benthic macroinvertebrates, algae and water quality. Field lead for California Energy Commission funded Spring Snowmelt Recession project, focused on quantifying the variability in the spring snowmelt flow regime compared to variability in abiotic stream conditions. Experience conducting statistical and geospatial analyses using ArcGIS, R, and JMP. Part of several interdisciplinary projects, including characterization and management of the spring snowmelt recession, assessing the effects of hydroclimatic change on meadow associated amphibians in the Sierra Nevada, integration of climate warming in the FERC hydrorelicensing process, and geomorphological flume modeling of riverine bar shape under different flow regimes. Research Projects included:

# TEACHING

*Instructor, Software/Data Carpentry* \hfill 2016, 2-3 wknds/yr

> Teach researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done using open source and reproducible tools. Specifically, have taught ecology/natural science and genomics workshops at Stanford, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute.

# PUBLIC MEDIA

“The Aggie Brickyard.” Co-Founder / Editor / Designer,  2015--present (2 hrs/wk).  

> https://aggiebrickyard.github.io *A quarterly magazine publication inspired and created solely by graduate students to serve as a conduit among students and faculty, and allowing us to bridge knowledge gaps and leverage the diversity of expertise we have here at UC Davis.*

"Nature's Confluence Blog" Contributing Writer, 2015--present.

> http://www.naturesconfluence.com *A blog to challenge the nature of conservation science, conventional conservation thinking, the conventional way of doing science. We are guilty of diligently demonstrating that human actions of all sorts have adverse impacts on nature, yet we also recognize that the incessant pointing out of problems, without offering solutions, is just plain annoying to people. We believe that seeking solutions often means re-thinking a problem. We mean to stimulate this re-thinking. We are striving to convey these stories at the confluence of science, nonscience and nonsense.*
